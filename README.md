Abstract
Healthcare in India has emerged as one of the largest and most vital sectors in terms of both revenue and employment. However, despite the increasing expansion of healthcare coverage and services, the escalating costs of medical treatment have created significant barriers for low-income populations, limiting their access to essential health services. This disparity has left a substantial portion of the poor population underserved and without adequate medical care.
This paper presents a comprehensive solution designed to address the healthcare access gap for economically disadvantaged groups in India. The proposed solution focuses on providing affordable, accessible, and high-quality medical services to underserved communities, leveraging technology, partnerships, and government support. Key components include the development of affordable healthcare insurance schemes, the deployment of telemedicine platforms, mobile health clinics, and the training of community health workers. Additionally, the initiative aims to foster collaborations with both governmental and non-governmental organizations to ensure widespread distribution of medical services and medications.
By creating a sustainable, community-centric healthcare model, the solution envisions improving the health outcomes of the poor while reducing the financial burden of medical expenses. Ultimately, this approach seeks to create a more equitable healthcare system that ensures every individual, regardless of income, has the right to access quality healthcare services.

MEDICAL SERVICES IN INDIA
• Public healthcare service is free for Indian
residents but has shortage of hospitals,
particularly in rural areas and semi urban areas
due to lack of equipment and resources.
• People in rural area not capable of paying the
expenses in the private hospitals.
• There are many people who wanted to offer
free medication to the poor people/needy but
cannot reach them.
• Even about the medical camps the people are
not aware due to lack of advertising

MEDICAL CAMPS IN INDIA

to people in life-threatening conditions whether
